## What is this?

An exploration into dynamic dark mode. Some applications are large, old and burdened by a lack of standards which makes supporting a dark mode theme harder than it needs to be. This project attempts to remedy that by providing an automatic dark mode while the hard work of refactoring the codebase, so a more performant and standard approach to themeing can be developed, is underway.
